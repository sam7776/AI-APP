[01:10:47] Q:  Tell me about yourself in brief with your tools and technologies.
[01:10:47] A: Hello, I am Nishant Meshram, a Solution Engineer at Deqode with four years of experience primarily focused on DevOps methodologies and infrastructure automation.

My core skill set includes AWS, Linux, and IaC using Terraform, alongside container orchestration with Kubernetes and Docker. For CI/CD, I extensively use Jenkins, Helm, and ArgoCD, ensuring robust pipelines for projects like our E-commerce platform.

I handle end-to-end observability, implementing Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring services across domains like Telecom and BaxterPlanning.

[01:11:43] Q:  Ok Sunishman, tell me, why should we hire you?
[01:11:43] A: Thank you for the opportunity. You should hire me because I bring four years of focused, hands-on experience as a Solution Engineer, specializing in building and maintaining resilient, scalable infrastructure.

I have proven expertise across the entire DevOps lifecycle, from provisioning large-scale resources using Terraform and AWS to managing complex deployments on Kubernetes using ArgoCD and Helm. For example, in my E-commerce project, I successfully optimized our CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, resulting in a 40% reduction in deployment time. I can immediately contribute to streamlining your operations and ensuring high availability.
----------------------------------------
[01:14:02] Q:  what kind of your contribution is in your projects.
[01:14:02] A: Across all my key projects—E-commerce, Telecom, and BaxterPlanning—my contribution centered on engineering robust, automated delivery systems.

For the E-commerce platform, I utilized Terraform to build and manage the entire AWS infrastructure stack, ensuring high availability and compliance. A major contribution was defining and implementing the end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and ArgoCD, automating deployments directly onto Kubernetes clusters, which reduced deployment time from 45 minutes to under 5 minutes.
